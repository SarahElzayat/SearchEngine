          <td> <h1 class="h1">Search Engines</h1> <p>A search engine is an <strong>online answering machine</strong>, which is used to search, understand, and organize content's result in its database based on the search query (keywords) inserted by the end-users (internet user). To display search results, all search engines first find the valuable result from their database, sort them to make an ordered list based on the search algorithm, and display in front of end-users. The process of organizing content in the form of a list is commonly known as a <strong>Search Engine Results Page (SERP)</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Yahoo!, Bing</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, and <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> are some popular examples of search engines.</p> <p>In our search engine tutorial, we are going to discuss the following topics -</p> 
           <ul class="points">

           <hr> <h2 id="Advantages" class="h2">Advantages of Search Engine</h2> <p>Searching content on the Internet becomes one of the most popular activities all over the world. In the current era, the search engine is an essential part of everyone's life because the search engine offers various popular ways to find valuable, relevant, and informative content on the Internet.</p> <p>A list of advantages of search engines is given below -</p> <h3 class="h3">1. Time-Saving</h3> <p>Search engine helps us to save time by the following two ways -</p> 
           <ul class="points"> 
            <li>Eliminate the need to find information manually.</li> 
            <li>Perform search operations at a very high speed.</li> 
           </ul> <h3 class="h3">2. Variety of information</h3> <p>The search engine offers various variety of resources to obtain relevant and valuable information from the Internet. By using a search engine, we can get information in various fields such as education, entertainment, games, etc. The information which we get from the search engine is in the form of blogs, pdf, ppt, text, images, videos, and audios.</p> <h3 class="h3">3. Precision</h3> <p>All search engines have the ability to provide more precise results.</p> <h3 class="h3">4. Free Access</h3> <p>Mostly search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo allow end-users to search their content for free. In search engines, there is no restriction related to a number of searches, so all end users (Students, Job seekers, IT employees, and others) spend a lot of time to search valuable content to fulfill their requirements.</p> <h3 class="h3">5. Advanced Search</h3> <p>Search engines allow us to use advanced search options to get relevant, valuable, and informative results. Advanced search results make our searches more flexible as well as sophisticated. For example, when you want to search for a specific site, type <strong>"site:"</strong> without quotes followed by the site's web address.</p> <p>Suppose we want to search for java tutorial on javaTpoint then type <strong>"java site:www.javatpoint.com"</strong> to get the advanced result quickly.</p> <p>To search about education institution sites (colleges and universities) for B.Tech in computer science engineering, then use <strong>"computer science engineering site:.edu."</strong> to get the advanced result.</p> <h3 class="h3">6. Relevance</h3> <p>Search engines allow us to search for relevant content based on a particular keyword. For example, a site "javatpoint" scores a higher search for the term "java tutorial" this is because a search engine sorts its result pages by the relevance of the content; that's why we can see the highest-scoring results at the top of SERP.</p> 
           <hr> <h2 id="Disadvantages" class="h2">Disadvantages of Search Engine</h2> <p>There are the following disadvantages of Search Engines -</p> 
           <ul class="points"> 
            <li>Sometimes the search engine takes too much time to display relevant, valuable, and informative content.</li> 
            <li>Search engines, especially Google, frequently update their algorithm, and it is very difficult to find the algorithm in which Google runs.</li> 
            <li>It makes end-users effortless as they all time use search engines to solve their small queries also.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <hr> <h2 id="Components" class="h2">Components of Search Engine</h2> <p>There are the following four basic components of Search Engine -</p> <h3 class="h3">1. Web Crawler</h3> <p>Web Crawler is also known as a <strong>search engine bot</strong>, <strong>web robot</strong>, or <strong>web spider</strong>. It plays an essential role in search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. It is mainly a software component that traverses on the web, then downloads and collects all the information over the Internet.</p> <h4 class="n">Note: Googlebot is the most popular web crawler.</h4> <p>There are the following web crawler features that can affect the search results -</p> 
           <ul class="points"> 
            <li>Included Pages</li> 
            <li>Excluded Pages</li> 
            <li>Document Types</li> 
            <li>Frequency of Crawling</li> 
           </ul> <h3 class="h3">2. Database</h3> <p>The search engine database is a type of <strong>Non-relational database</strong>. It is the place where all the web information is stored. It has a large number of web resources. Some most popular search engine databases are <strong>Amazon Elastic Search Service</strong> and <strong>Splunk</strong>.</p> <p>There are the following two database variable features that can affect the search results:</p> 
           <ul class="points"> 
            <li>Size of the database</li> 
            <li>The freshness of the database</li> 
           </ul> <h3 class="h3">3. Search Interfaces</h3> <p>Search Interface is one of the most important components of Search Engine. It is an interface between the user and the database. It basically helps users to search for queries using the database.</p> <p>There are the following features Search Interfaces that affect the search results -</p> 
           <ul class="points"> 
            <li>Operators</li> 
            <li>Phrase Searching</li> 
            <li>Truncation</li> 
           </ul> <h3 class="h3">4. Ranking Algorithms</h3> <p>The ranking algorithm is used by Google to rank web pages according to the Google search algorithm.</p> <p>There are the following ranking features that affect the search results -</p> 
           <ul class="points"> 
            <li>Location and frequency</li> 
            <li>Link Analysis</li> 
            <li>Clickthrough measurement</li> 
           </ul> 
           <hr> <h2 id="How" class="h2">How do search engines work</h2> <p>There are the following tasks done by every search engines -</p> <h3 class="h3">1. Crawling</h3> <p>Crawling is the first stage in which a search engine uses web crawlers to find, visit, and download the web pages on the WWW (World Wide Web). Crawling is performed by software robots, known as "<strong>spiders</strong>" or "<strong>crawlers</strong>." These robots are used to review the website content.</p> <h3 class="h3">2. Indexing</h3> <p>Indexing is an online library of websites, which is used to sort, store, and organize the content that we found during the crawling. Once a page is indexed, it appears as a result of the most valuable and most relevant query.</p> <h3 class="h3">3. Ranking and Retrieval</h3> <p>The ranking is the last stage of the search engine. It is used to provide a piece of content that will be the best answer based on the user's query. It displays the best content at the top rank of the website.</p> <p>To know more about how the search engine works click on the following link -</p> <p><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/how-search-engine-works">https://www.javatpoint.com/how-search-engine-works</a></p> 
           <hr> <h2 id="Processing" class="h2">Search Engine Processing</h2> <p>There are following two major Search Engine processing functions -</p> <h3 class="h3">1. Indexing process</h3> <p>Indexing is the process of building a structure that enables searching.</p> <p>Indexing process contains the following three blocks -</p> <p><strong>i. Text acquisition</strong></p> <p>It is used to identify and store documents for indexing.</p> <p><strong>ii. Text transformation</strong></p> <p>It is the process of transform documents into index or features.</p> <p><strong>iii. Index creation</strong></p> <p>Index creation takes the output from text transformation and creates the indexes or data searches that enable fast searching.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/search-engines/images/search-engines1.png" alt="Search Engines"> <h3 class="h3">2. Query process</h3> <p>The query is the process of producing the list of documents based on a user's search query.</p> <p>There are the following three tasks of the Query process -</p> <p><strong>i. User interaction</strong></p> <p>User interaction provides an interface between the users who search the content and the search engine.</p> <p><strong>ii. Ranking</strong></p> <p>The ranking is the core component of the search engine. It takes query data from the user interaction and generates a ranked list of data based on the retrieval model.</p> <p><strong>iii. Evaluation</strong></p> <p>Evaluation is used to measure and monitor the effectiveness and efficiency. The evaluation result helps us to improve the ranking of the search engine.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/search-engines/images/search-engines2.png" alt="Search Engines"> 
           <hr> <h2 id="updates" class="h2">Search Engine (Google) algorithm updates</h2> <p>Before learning about search engine algorithm, first, understand</p> <h3 class="h3">What is an algorithm?</h3> <p>An algorithm is a set of instructions that we use to solve an infinite number of problems.</p> <p>Google's algorithm also follows some set of rules to solve the problem. Google's algorithm is very complex to understand and use because Google changes its algorithm very frequently, which is very tough for users to identify in which algorithm currently, Google is working.</p> <p>The search engine uses a combination of algorithms to deliver webpages based on the relevance rank of a webpage on its search engine results pages (SERPs).</p> <p>There are the following major updates occurred in Google's algorithm -</p> <h3 class="h3">1. Google Panda</h3> <p>Google Panda update was the major change made in Google's search result. It a search filter introduced on <strong>23 February 2011</strong>. The name "Panda" derives from Google's Engineer <strong>Mr. Navneet Panda</strong>, who made it possible for Google to create and implement the Google Panda Update. The aim of Google Panda update is to reduce the occurrence of low-quality content, duplicate content, and thin content in the search results. It contains unique as well as valuable results at the top of the search engine page ranking.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/search-engines/images/search-engines3.png" alt="Search Engines"> <h3 class="h3">2. Google Penguin</h3> <p>In <strong>April 2012</strong>, Google launched the "<strong>webspam algorithm update</strong>." This webspam algorithm later called a <strong>Penguin algorithm</strong>. Currently, Penguin is a part of the core Google search engine algorithm. It is mainly designed to target <strong>link spam</strong>, <strong>manipulative link building practices</strong>, as well as <strong>webpage's scoring</strong> when crawled and indexed, which are analyzed by Google.</p> <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/search-engines/images/search-engines4.png" alt="Search Engines"> <h3 class="h3">3. Google Hummingbird</h3> <p>Google Hummingbird was introduced on <strong>August 20, 2013</strong>. Hummingbird focuses more attention to each word in a search query to bring better results. It is able to catch users and find the content that matches the best intent.
